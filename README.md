Cafe Seat Reservation Website<br/>

## Project Introduction

### Meaning of the project name
We made this website so the users can freely "zzim"(meaning reserving in Korean) the seat in any of the trendy cafe just like we can book nice restaurants. 

### Goal of the project
Cafes in today's era have gone beyond just the meaning of a place to drink a coffee. 
The reasons for visiting the cafe are various: studying, working, enjoying spare time, and business meetings, etc. 
By creating this website customers can freely choose the seat at cafe, at the time they want, and they can also order the menu.
